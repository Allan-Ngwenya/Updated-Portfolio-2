				<p>I am a training Full-Stack Javascript developer with cloud experience.
					Learning about new technology and training to improve my skilset is something that I enjoy and
					take pride in doing. My tenacious drive and curiosity has recently lead me to embark on the
					journey of becoming a Full-Stack Javascript developer. I

					journey and check out the cool projects I have put together!
					From the start of my career in IT I have challenged myself to be an engineer with great
					technical
					abilities, review my most recent experiences in my CV. I am currently woking as an Azure DevOps
					Engineer.</p>
